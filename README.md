# About the program
This project tracks Bitcoin prices in Indian currency (INR), which can be changed if wished, and plots a live graph. To use this one needs to run the first code, 'Live Bitcoin Data Generator' on the terminal, and the other named 'Live Bitcoin Line Chart', on an IDE simultaneously. The first code creates a CSV file: 'Live Bitcoin Price Today.csv', that will contain live Bitcoin prices per minute from the time of running till the end. While the other code plots the data on an animated line chart which updates every minute.
